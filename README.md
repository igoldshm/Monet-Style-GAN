# MonetGAN - Monet-Style Painting Generation
This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) aimed at transforming photos into Monet-style paintings. The model was developed for the MonetGAN challenge on Kaggle.
The goal of the challenge was to use a GAN to take input photos and generate Monet-style paintings. The challenge serves as an excellent introduction to GANs and image-to-image translation tasks.
